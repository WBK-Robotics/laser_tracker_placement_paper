We define this layout design as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that aims to optimize the placement of workcell components by minimizing the distance traveled between task sequences while maximizing the robot's manipulability. Suitable constraints guarantee the reachability as well as the absence of collisions. We solve this optimization problem via a genetic algorithm, and demonstrate it in three scenarios for a dual-arm robotic system that assembles product variants out of aluminum profiles.},

abstract="Multi-robot motion planning problems often have many local minima. It is essential to visualize those local minima such that we can better understand, debug and interact with multi-robot systems. Towards this goal, we present the multi-robot motion explorer, an algorithm which extends previous results on multilevel Morse theory by introducing a component-based framework, where we reduce multi-robot configuration spaces by reducing each robots component space using fiber bundles. Our algorithm exploits this component structure to search for and visualize local minima. A user of the algorithm can specify a multilevel abstraction and an optimization algorithm. We use this information to incrementally build a local minima tree for a given problem. We demonstrate this algorithm on several multi-robot systems of up to 20 degrees of freedom.",

Line-less mobile assembly systems (LMAS) represent a paradigm aimed at producing large products in small lot sizes. One enabler for LMAS is the automated planning and evaluation of spatial configurations of assembly resources regarding the executability of the assembly tasks. Criteria for executability are the reachability and manipulability measures of the assembly resource. To overcome extensive simulations and case-studies, faster solutions for executability evaluations are necessary. This paper surveys methods of base placement of robots, for utilisation in online assembly configuration planning. Based on the survey, research gaps are identified. A task clustering algorithm for preselection of spatially distributed task sets into task sequences executable from discrete base placements is presented. Clustering overcomes the often applied assumption that the set of given tasks has to be reachable from one discrete base placement.},

But repeatability is not a global property, instead, it strongly depends on the robot's workspace position. This is currently ignored in robot cell planning leading to a loss of actual repeatability. This paper not only quantifies this loss but presents a new algorithm that finds the optimal position of a workpiece such that repeatability is optimized. The predictions of this algorithm are verified using digital twin simulations on different robots which show up to nine times higher repeatability than with the unoptimized position.},

@article{stiffness_placement,
  abstract  = {Robots have various advantages such as multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs), flexibility, and cost efficiency. Although robots have mostly been utilized for painting, welding, pick-and-place, and assembly tasks, robot machining has been actively introduced in many fields to maximize productivity. The main obstacle to robot machining is the poor stiffness of robots, which is lower than that of conventional machine tools. Low stiffness induces compliance errors that deteriorate machining quality. One effort to improve stiffness is tool path compensation, in which compliance errors are predicted and compensated for by utilizing a stiffness model. Another approach to solving the stiffness problem is posture optimization, in which a performance index is defined based on the stiffness model. Such a performance index evaluates stiffness according to the configuration of a robot. Using this index, one can optimize the posture of a robot to maximize stiffness during machining. In previous studies, optimization was performed for the redundant DOF in the spindle axis direction at a given position, assuming a fixed workpiece and vertical feed direction. However, workpiece placement also has to be optimized in the robot workspace to obtain the optimal machining posture. This study introduced a novel approach to posture optimization. A deformation energy model that can evaluate stiffness from an energy perspective was proposed. With the proposed method, the posture of the robot and the workpiece position can be optimized simultaneously. Global optimization was performed within the entire workspace, and simulations were conducted to verify the optimization results. Additionally, local optimization considering the working environment was performed to deal with the practical problems in real scenarios. The results of optimization were verified experimentally.},

  abstract  = {Low stiffness characteristics limit the application of industrial robots in the field of precision manufacturing. This paper focuses primarily on the stiffness properties of drilling robots by further studying the stiffness ellipsoid model. A Cartesian compliance model is proposed to describe the robot stiffness in Cartesian space. Based on the compliance model, a quantitative evaluation index of the robot's processing performance is defined. By choosing a proper drilling posture, the performance index in the cutting tool direction is optimized. Higher accuracy of the countersink depth and hole axial direction can be guaranteed. From the perspective of the robot processing mechanism, the key role of the per-load pressing force is first indicated. By applying a per-load pressing force, the performance index on the machining plane is enhanced. Hole diameter accuracy is improved significantly. A stiffness improving factor used to evaluate the stiffness promotion degree is also proposed. Finally, experiments were conducted to verify the correctness of the proposed model. Drilling experiments were performed to investigate the effectiveness of the robot processing performance index improving methods The principle of pressing force used in engineering applications is given based on processing parameters.},

abstract = {Computing the optimal geometric structure of manipulators is one of the most intricate problems in contemporary robot kinematics. Robotic manipulators are designed and built to perform certain predetermined tasks. There is a very close relationship between the structure of the manipulator and its kinematic performance. It is therefore important to incorporate such task requirements during the design and synthesis of the robotic manipulators. Such task requirements and performance constraints can be specified in terms of the required end-effector positions, orientations and velocities along the task trajectory. In this work, we present a comprehensive method to develop the optimal geometric structure (DH parameters) of a non-redundant six degree of freedom serial manipulator from task descriptions. In this work we define, develop and test a methodology to design optimal manipulator configurations based on task descriptions. This methodology is devised to investigate all possible manipulator configurations that can satisfy the task performance requirements under imposed joint constraints. Out of all the possible structures, the structures that can reach all the task points with the required orientations are selected. Next, these candidate structures are tested to see whether they can attain end-effector velocities in arbitrary directions within the user defined joint constraints, so that they can deliver the best kinematic performance. Additionally least power consuming configurations are also identified.}

Unlike related publications, the approach does not utilize simplifications of the kinematic structures. In addition, it is also capable of generating manipulators with up to six degrees of freedom. The approach reduces the computational effort by automatically generating the task-suitable architectures together with their corresponding optimisation parameters. Since the kinematics modelling is one of the main challenges, an algorithm for the numerical solution of the inverse kinematics is introduced. Finally, in order to demonstrate the capability of the method, the optimal manipulator for a pick and place operation is found using kinematic performance indices and particle swarm optimisation.},

We apply our method to two distinct problems where rapid prototyping and customization are desirable: an arm prototyped for a future Mars mission, and a wearable backpack-mounted arm. We then propose a novel method to minimize the number of joints in the mechanism while maintaining its ability to reach workspace task poses.
